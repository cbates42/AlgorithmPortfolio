## Big O:

Big-O Notation is really interesting. I've kind of thought of optimization before, but it is really interesting to think of it as Constant, Linear, and Quadratic. I'm interested in working in games, and thinking of ways Linear algorithms could be used is really interesting (like storing randomly generated enemies in a list and pulling them out one at a time etc).
