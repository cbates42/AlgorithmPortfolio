## Big O:

Big-O Notation is really interesting. I've kind of thought of optimization before, but it is really interesting to think of it as Constant, Linear, and Quadratic. I'm interested in working in games, and thinking of ways Linear algorithms could be used is really interesting (like storing randomly generated enemies in a list and pulling them out one at a time etc).

## Data Structures:

Array: Collection of elements of the same type that can be accessed by their index. Useful for when you know the number of items won't change. Efficient for reading but not for adding/removing.

Map/Dictionary: Stores data in key-value pairs. Each key is unique and mapped to a value. Useful for when values need to be associated with unique keys and you need to access the items quickly. Efficient for reading.

Stack: Stores data with last-in first-out. Elements can only be added or removed from the top. Useful for things like an undo function. Efficient specifically for removing the latest element or adding a new element but not for accessing other elements and searching.

Queue: Similar to Stack, but stores data with First-in first-out. Elements get added to the end of the line and are removed when they reach the front of the line. Useful when items need to be handled in order, literally like a line. Efficient for specifically adding elements to the end of the line and removing them from the front, not efficient for accessing other elements or searching.
